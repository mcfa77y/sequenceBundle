Sequence Bundles Web Tool website development briefing


Context

The Sequence Bundles Web Tool is currently functioning from a  server running locally. We are in the process of setting up a collaborator’s account on EBI servers and still waiting for confirmation from Roland. We are also working towards showing the Web Tool on iPads at a show in NY.

Ultimately, “Web Tool” webpage will be accompanied by “About” page and “Desktop App” page. Because of Roland’s work on publishing Alvis, we are freezing the release of “Desktop App” page until the publication is confirmed.

We are working based on previous designs and assets provided to Joe in December. Because of changes in visual and UI design, some elements need to be brought to parity with previous designs, other require further redesign and asset work.


Aims

Objectives:

Phase 1:
In which we set up the lean version of the web tool for NY show.

JL, JG and JK to place Web Tool on server (EBI server if we get access before March 23, SP server if we don’t get access to EBI servers by then).


Phase 2:
In which we complete work on Web Tool and link up ‘About’ page.
Deadline: March/April (provided we get access to EBI servers)

MK to prepare spec and assets for JL to implement remaining changes in Web Tool (including all three upload options, scrolling of preview, sharing and citing, new assets).

Phase 3:
